# Ranges

Check ranges with a simple click and drag - no need to dagger through complex menus or settings. Perfect for when you need rough distance estimates at the heart of your workflow.

## Use the tool

This extension adds a new Range mode to the measure tool.

Once this tool is selected you can view ranges by holding and draging in the Scene.
If you move a token while this tool is active the range will stay stationary so you can see how far your token has moved.

## Color Blind Themes

As well as the base theme there are three color themes that target specific color blindess.

These themes can be found using the Range Theme action.

## Adjust Settings

The GM can control the labels, shape and size of a range.

To do this use the Range Settings action.

You can then pick from a list of presets or create your own range.

When creating your own range you can give it a name, toggle showing the ring labels or sizes and change the shape between a circle or square.
