# Ranges

A quick and easy tool for measuring circular distances on maps. Check ranges with a simple click and drag - no need to dagger through complex menus or settings. Perfect for when you need rough distance estimates at the heart of your workflow.

## Use the tool

This extension adds a new Range mode to the measure tool.

Once this tool is selected you can view ranges by holding and draging in the Scene.
If you move a token while this tool is active the range will stay stationary so you can see how far your token has moved.
